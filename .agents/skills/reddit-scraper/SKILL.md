# Reddit Scraper

## Overview

This skill allows you to fetch and display the latest posts from any public subreddit. It uses the Reddit JSON API (adding `.json` to subreddit URLs) to retrieve data without robust authentication headers, making it lightweight for simple retrieval tasks.

## Capabilities

1.  **Fetch Latest Posts**: Retrieve the top 3 newest posts (title, author, score, URL, content preview).
2.  **CLI Chat Interface**: A simple interactive loop to query multiple subreddits in a row.

## Usage

### 1. Interactive Chat Mode
To start an interactive session where you can query subreddits one by one:

```bash
python3 .agent/skills/reddit-scraper/scripts/chat_interface.py
```

### 2. Direct Query (Single Subreddit)
To fetch the latest posts for a specific subreddit (e.g., `n8n`) directly:

```bash
python3 .agent/skills/reddit-scraper/scripts/fetch_posts.py Singularity --sort top --time week --limit 3
```

Arguments:
- `subreddit`: Name of the subreddit.
- `--sort`: Sort order (new, hot, top, rising, controversial). Default: new.
- `--time`: Time filter (hour, day, week, month, year, all). Default: all.
- `--limit`: Number of results. Default: 3.

### 3. Advanced Search (Filtered by Query)
To search for posts within a subreddit with specific filters (query, time, sort):

```bash
python3 .agent/skills/reddit-scraper/scripts/fetch_filtered_posts.py Singularity "women's fashion" --sort top --time week --limit 3
```

Arguments:
- `subreddit`: Name of the subreddit.
- `query`: Search term.
- `--sort`: Sort order (relevance, hot, top, new, comments). Default: top.
- `--time`: Time filter (hour, day, week, month, year, all). Default: week.
- `--limit`: Number of results. Default: 3.

## Dependencies

This skill requires the `requests` library.
Check if it's installed:
```bash
pip list | grep requests
```
Install if missing:
```bash
pip install requests
```

## Implementation Details

The scripts are located in `scripts/`:
- `fetch_posts.py`: Contains the `get_latest_posts` function and CLI entry point.
- `fetch_filtered_posts.py`: Helper script for searching posts with filters (query, time, sort).
- `chat_interface.py`: Imports `fetch_posts` and runs the input loop.

**Note:** The scripts use a custom User-Agent to avoid immediate 429 (Too Many Requests) errors from Reddit, but heavy usage might still trigger rate limits.
